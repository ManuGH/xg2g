# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Use docker-compose.yml instead!
#
# This file is deprecated. The main docker-compose.yml now supports all 3 modes
# in a single unified configuration file.
#
# Migration guide:
# 1. Copy docker-compose.yml
# 2. Uncomment the MODE 2 section (Audio Transcoding)
# 3. Set your OpenWebif credentials
# 4. docker compose up -d
#
# See: docker-compose.yml for the new unified configuration
#
# This file will be removed in a future release.
