## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-29

### Added

#### üõ°Ô∏è Comprehensive Security Framework
- **Symlink boundary protection**: Real-time validation prevents symlink escape attacks
- **Path traversal protection**: Comprehensive input validation blocks directory traversal attempts  
- **HTTP method restrictions**: Only GET/HEAD allowed for file endpoints, 405 for others
- **Directory listing prevention**: All directory access attempts return 403 Forbidden

#### üìä Production Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus metrics integration**: Comprehensive performance and security metrics
- **Grafana dashboards**: Real-time security and operational visibility  
- **AlertManager integration**: Automatic alerting for security events and operational issues
- **Docker Compose monitoring**: Complete production-ready monitoring stack

#### üö® Security Metrics & Alerting
- **Real-time security tracking**: Metrics for denied requests by attack type
- **Performance monitoring**: Request latencies, retry counts, success/failure rates
- **Automated alerts**: SymlinkAttackSpike, HTTPErrorRateHigh, HighLatencyP95
- **Security dashboards**: 6-panel Grafana dashboard with security focus

#### ‚ö° Automated Security Testing  
- **Comprehensive penetration testing**: 20+ attack vectors in automated test suite
- **CI/CD security validation**: Quick 4-test validation for deployment pipelines
- **Attack pattern coverage**: Path traversal, symlink escapes, method restrictions, edge cases
- **JSON result tracking**: Detailed test results with timestamps and response analysis

### Security

#### üîí Defense-in-Depth Implementation
- **Multiple security layers**: Application, middleware, and filesystem-level protection
- **Attack vector coverage**: Addresses CWE-22 (Path Traversal), CWE-59 (Symlink Following)
- **Real-time detection**: Immediate blocking with structured logging and metrics
- **Zero false positives**: Legitimate file access unaffected by security measures

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-29

### Added

- **NEW**: Separate Prometheus metrics server with configurable address (`XG2G_METRICS_LISTEN`)
- **NEW**: IPv6 address validation with proper bracket notation support ([::]:9090)
- **NEW**: Metrics server deactivation option (empty `XG2G_METRICS_LISTEN`)
- Comprehensive retry and timeout configuration for OpenWebIF requests
- Exponential backoff with configurable limits
- Prometheus metrics for request latencies, retry counts, and error classification
- Context cancellation support with proper cleanup
- English-only policy for all project communication
- GitHub issue and pull request templates
- Comprehensive test suite for configuration validation and retry scenarios
- Table-driven tests for address validation covering IPv4, IPv6, hostnames

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Metrics server now runs on separate port (:9090) instead of main API server
- **BREAKING**: `XG2G_METRICS_PORT` deprecated in favor of `XG2G_METRICS_LISTEN`
- **BEHAVIOR CHANGE**: Request retry logic now uses exponential backoff (previously immediate retry)
- **BEHAVIOR CHANGE**: Default timeout increased from 5s to 10s per request attempt
- **BEHAVIOR CHANGE**: Maximum retry attempts reduced from unlimited to 3 by default
- Improved structured logging with consistent field names (`attempt`, `duration_ms`, `error_class`)
- Enhanced CI pipeline with markdownlint and comprehensive quality checks
- Docker Compose now exposes metrics port 9090 optionally

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: IPv6 address parsing error causing metrics server startup failures
- **CRITICAL**: Address validation now properly handles IPv6 bracket notation
- Context cancellation now properly prevents goroutine leaks
- Removed unused middleware function causing linting errors
- Fixed port range validation (0-65535) with proper error messages
- Race conditions in concurrent request handling
- Code quality issues (go vet lostcancel warnings, formatting)

### Configuration

New environment variables for stability tuning:

- `XG2G_OWI_TIMEOUT_MS` (default: 10000) - Timeout per request attempt
- `XG2G_OWI_RETRIES` (default: 3) - Maximum retry attempts  
- `XG2G_OWI_BACKOFF_MS` (default: 500) - Base backoff delay
- `XG2G_OWI_MAX_BACKOFF_MS` (default: 2000) - Maximum backoff delay

### Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from a previous version:

1. **Timeout Changes**: The new default timeout is 10s per attempt (previously 5s total). If your receiver is very fast, consider setting `XG2G_OWI_TIMEOUT_MS=5000`

2. **Retry Behavior**: Retries now use exponential backoff. If you have a very slow receiver, you may need to increase `XG2G_OWI_MAX_BACKOFF_MS=5000`

3. **Monitoring**: New Prometheus metrics are available. Update your dashboards to include:
   - `xg2g_openwebif_request_duration_seconds` for latency percentiles
   - `xg2g_openwebif_request_retries_total` for retry rates
   - `xg2g_openwebif_request_failures_total` for error monitoring
