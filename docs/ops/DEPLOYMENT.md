# Deployment (Index)

This document is now split into two canonical sources:

- Runtime contract (GPU/FFmpeg/paths): `docs/ops/DEPLOYMENT_RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md`
- Operator runbook (systemd + Compose): `docs/ops/RUNBOOK_SYSTEMD_COMPOSE.md`

If you are looking for systemd, start/stop/reload, or smoke checks, use the runbook.
If you are looking for FFmpeg, GPU, or runtime invariants, use the runtime contract.
