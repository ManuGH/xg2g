# xg2g Documentation Portal

Welcome to the normative documentation for xg2g.
To ensure consistency and "Operator-Grade" quality,
all documentation follows a strict hierarchy.

## 🏁 Entry Point

The single source of truth for the system's design
and decision logic is the **Spec Index**:

👉 **[SPEC_INDEX.md](file:///root/xg2g/docs/decision/SPEC_INDEX.md)**

## 📚 Documentation Structure

### [ADR/](file:///root/xg2g/docs/ADR/)

Architectural Decision Records. These are immutable once accepted
and define the "why" behind the system's construction.

### [ops/](file:///root/xg2g/docs/ops/)

Operational playbooks, incident management, and deployment invariants.

### [arch/](file:///root/xg2g/docs/arch/)

High-level architectural diagrams and service boundary definitions.

### [archive/](file:///root/xg2g/docs/archive/)

Legacy documentation and superseded ADRs. Reference only.
